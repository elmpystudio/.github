# Get the max of your that with the easier way to do machine learning in Python without coding!

PyStudio is an open-source machine learning platform to train and deploy ML models in a workflow environment. It allows you to go from preparing data to deploying a model within seconds. PyStudio is designed to avoid coding in ML experiments just drag and drop, some features are the following:

-	Preprocessing (Data Preparation, Feature Engineering and Feature Selection)
-	Model Selection (over 20 ready-to-use algorithms)
-	Model Evaluation for classification and regression.
-	Exposing Model as a service.
-	Share your data and models on the marketplace.
-	Easy way to integrate your algorithms in the studio.
